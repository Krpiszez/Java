        "Lists" are flexible for length but "Arrays" are not.
        "Lists" are for store multiple data in the same data type like "Arrays".
        "Lists" store non-primitive data types Arrays can not.
        "Lists" can not store primitive data types.
        "Lists" have many useful methods.
        "Arrays" are so fast.
        "Arrays" uses memory so less*/
