Recursive solutions with memoization :
    Make it work ->
     * visualize the problem as a tree.
     * implement the tree using recursion.
     * test it.

    Make it efficent ->
     * add a memo object (map)
     * add a base case to return memo values.
     * store retun values into memo.

Tabulated solutions:
    * visualize the problem as a table
    * size the table based on the inputs
    * initialize the table with default values
    * seed the trivial answer into the table (base)
    * iterate through the table
    * fill further positions based on the current position

Overall DP:
Notice any overlapping subproblems.
Decide what is the trivially smallest input.
Think recursively use memoization.
Think iteratively use tabulation.
Draw a strategy first.
