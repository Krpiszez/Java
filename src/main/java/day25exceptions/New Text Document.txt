Exception is parent class of lots of exception classes like ArithmeticException NullPointerException... Exception is unexpected things. For example you are planning
to go for a trip and you checked your car and everything is in perfect condition, like tires gas and oil etc. But on your way your tire got flat so this was
unexpected. When exception occurs the application is blocked and codes will not be keep executing. To prevent that there is try - catch blocks we use try catch blocks
to prevent app to be blocked. First the code we want to executed we type it in try and in catch parenthesis we type the possible exception according to our
method. A try block cannot be used without a catch block at least but it can work with multiple catch blocks. There might be more than 1 exceptions in a single task
for scenarios like that Exception itself can be used in catch block.. Exception is parent of child exception classes so it will include the exception and 
.getMessage() method will return the exception message of whatever the exception is. After using try- catch block the related code will give the error as output or 
execute the codes that you typed inside catch block body then it goes on to execute other codes.
